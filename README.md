# My Booking Website v1
 A car booking website I made for a web dev assignment in 2023. It displays a list of cars that are hardcoded to the website in script.js. 
 Any car that is 'booked' is added to session storage and can be viewed, removed, cleared, or submitted from the booking page. Session storage is cleared once the session is ended (browser is closed).
 
 It uses bootstrap templates to handle the webstie GUI.
